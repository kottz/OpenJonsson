## Current Status  
‚ö†Ô∏è Early prototype - not yet playable. Most of the basic systems work, but the actual gameplay is currently limited to walking around.

## Getting Started

### Asset Extraction (using Docker)
OpenJ√∂nsson uses original game assets. You need to provide your own legitimate copy of *J√∂nssonligan: Jakten p√• Mj√∂lner* to proceed.

We will extract and process the assets using [cgex](https://github.com/kottz/cgex). The easiest way to do this is by using the provided docker container. To begin first:

1. Create a `disc_contents` directory and a `resources` directory for the output.
2. Insert game CD or mount your .iso and copy everything on the CD into the `disc_contents` folder.
4. Run the docker container with the command below. This can take a while.

```bash
mkdir disc_contents
mkdir resources
docker run --rm \
  -v ./disc_contents:/input:ro \
  -v ./resources:/output \
  kottz/cgex:latest
```

Then clone the project if you haven't already and copy the `resources` folder to `static/resources` in the OpenJ√∂nsson repository.

### Running the Game
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kottz/openjonsson
cp -r resources openjonsson/static/
cd openjonsson
cargo run --release
```

Compile and run the game with `cargo run --release`.

## Legal
OpenJ√∂nsson is not affiliated with Korkeken AB or the original game creators. You must provide original game assets from a legally acquired copy.
